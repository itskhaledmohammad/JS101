## How to take Input from user
For example in this code we take the user's name as input and then alert it back to the user.
```JS
let name = prompt("What is your name?");
alert(name);
```
When you want to take an input from the user, you declare a variable with a name of your choosing and then assign that variable to whatever is returned bby the prompt function. 

###FAQ
**Is prompt a function?**  
Yes.  

**Can you prove to me that this is a function?**
How do you call a function? Well first you write the name of the function and then you put an opening round bracket and a closing round bracket after it. Like eg. `alert()` now the opening and closing bracket may or may not have "arguments" between them.  

**What is an argument?**  
You know when you have a disagreement with someone and they tell you their side of the story and you tell yours and you disagree even more later. Yeah, that's an argument. But thankfully in JS the disagreement doesn't continue for very long and it is a way to provide new informtion to a function.

**So how do we do that?**  
Well you just provide the information required in between the brackets like `alert("Potato")` potato is the argument. Or the argument could also be a variable for example in the second line of the code above. `alert(name)`. `name` here is a variable being used as an argument to the `alert` function.

## Objects
You know what sucks? I'll tell you what sucks. When you want to store a lot of related information about one particular thing you need to make a lot of variables. It's much worse when you have multiple "particular things" each with more than one piece of information about itself.

Allow me to demonstrate. I want to store the name, age and race of 3 people. Here's how we'd do it with variables.

```JS
let person_1_name = "Samiha";
let person_1_age = 20;
let person_1_race = "black";

let person_2_name = "Zakia";
let person_2_age = 19;
let person_2_race = "hispanic";

let person_3_name = "Sartaj";
let person_3_age = 18;
let person_3_race = "number";
```

Accessing the information in these variable sucks equally as much for example:

```JS
alert(person_2_age);
alert(person_3_race);
alert(person_2_name);
```

What if there was a better way than being careful to name all your variables the same way? What if there was a way to group pieces of information together? THAT IS WHERE OBJECTS COME IN.

Let's make an object _(evil grin)_.

```JS
let person_1 = {
    name: "Samiha",
    age: 20,
    race: "black"
};
```

WEEEE. Okay let's access this information.

```JS

```
